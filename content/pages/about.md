I first tested the entrepreneurial waters selling the eggs of our chickens. No VC, no team, just bootstrapping. Also, I was 10 or something.

To learn more about innovative things I went to the cosy south of the Netherlands: Eindhoven. It turns out innovations are madly interesting. So are legal things, and ethics, evolutionary economics. But most of all: sustainability and sustainable energy in particulair. 

With no time to waste I joined [The New Motion](https://www.newmotion.com) (now NewMotion, owned by Shell) in the early days and learned about electric mobility and, strange enough, billing and invoicing. I also did a surprising amount of programming. 

After joining another startup that didn't make any sense in hindsight, I had to go on a cruise ship and take a sabbatical for 3 months. Cooking, lots of cooking, for the last month, in the south of France. 

Since then I've spend my time consulting in various projects on companies that I think are worth my time, and vice versa:

* Connected [Oneplanetcrowd](https://www.oneplanetcrowd.com) to actual money lending software, as opposed to, well, spreadsheets...
* Set up a simple premium package for [Relive](https://www.relive.cc). They have 4M users now, so I think they're doing OK.
* Switched the [Codaisseur](https://www.codaisseur.com) curriculum, a 10 week programming bootcamp, from Ruby-on-Rails to 100% Javascript & Typescript. I've brought a lot of graduates to companies that I consult for ever since, because they learned good things :-).
* Currently in progress: [Sungevity Europe](https://www.sungevity.nl). Great things ahead.
